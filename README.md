New Constructs is creating a new paradigm for fundamental data. This repo contains code examples for interacting with our API.

#### Access Plans
Access to our API is included with all [New Constructs Memberships](https://www.newconstructs.com/membership/), including individual investor and professional plans. Please contact [support](mailto:support@newconstructs.com?subject=[GitHub]%20NC%20Code%20Samples) for more information.

##### Gold, Platinum, and Pro access includes:

* Full access to our Reference Datasets, Coverage and Datapoints
* Access to our Overall Rating, Component Ratings, Reported Fundamentals, and Adjusted Fundamentals endpoints for any securities in your portfolio*
* Relevant samples are in the [all_member](https://github.com/newconstructs-code-samples/nc-api-examples/tree/master/python/all_member) directory
* 10,000 API requests per month. Accessing data for 1 datapoint, for 1 security, for 1 time period = 1 request. Requests reset on the first of the month.

*Because our API only refreshes once per day, tickers added to your portfolio will not be available for API requests until the next day.

##### Unlimited and Institutional access includes:

* Full access to our Reference Datasets, Coverage and Datapoints
* Full access to our Overall Rating, Component Ratings, Reported Fundamentals, Adjusted Fundamentals, and Sector endpoints
* Relevant samples are in the [all_member](https://github.com/newconstructs-code-samples/nc-api-examples/tree/master/python/all_member) and [institutional_and_a_la_carte](https://github.com/newconstructs-code-samples/nc-api-examples/tree/master/python/institutional_and_a_la_carte) directories
* 10,000 API requests per month. Accessing data for 1 datapoint, for 1 security, for 1 time period = 1 request. Requests reset on the first of the month.

For Unlimited and Institutional members, securities do not need to be in your portfolio to access their data.

#### Coverage
We offer access to a wide range of datasets via our API, covering

* 5,000+ U.S. Exchange-traded stocks
* 650+ ETFs
* 7,050+ mutual funds

with history back to 1998.
